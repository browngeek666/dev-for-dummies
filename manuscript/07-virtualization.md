# Servers, Virtualization, And Containers

Software we're building would be useless without a place to run it. If we exclude desktop applications (those that run on your laptop), everything we create runs on servers. What are they? *A server is a computer or a device on a network that manages network resources.* That was one more of those definitions understood only by those who already know what a server is. If we translate it to "plain English", a server is a computer that runs our software. It is, in a way, not much conceptually different than the computer you're using. The only important difference is that servers are optimized to "serve" applications. The only notable difference is that servers often do not have a monitor since they are not used by us directly. They tend to be more potent than laptops but they still have the same components. There is memory, hard disk, CPU, and so on.

At the begging, we were deploying our applications to *bare metal* servers.

## Bare Metal

Running applications on bare metal servers means that there is nothing between your application and the server. An application, a customer, a department, or a team would get their own dedicated server. Such a combination is often called *single tenant server*. *From performance perspective, this is the best choice*. There are no intermediaries between your application and a server allowing you to get maximum performance since nothing is wasting resources.

Single tenancy allows you to *avoid the noisy neighbor effect*. If multiple applications are running on the same server, they are impacting each others performance and stability.

The potential of breaking regulatory compliance in a multitenant environment was the main reason why security-sensitive organizations might be reluctant to move to some other option for hosting their applications. With bare-metal servers, it is possible to implement *physical segregation of resources*.

Let's say that we deploy two applications to a single server. If one of them is heavily used, it might, for example, occupy all available memory. As a result, the other application would become slow and unresponsive. If we're hosting a single application on a single server, such a problem is avoided. No one can impact our performance but ourselves.

If your application is sensitive to performance, bare metal can be unbeatable. It is faster than any other option we might choose.

However, not everything is on a bright side with bare metal. It has its own set of disadvantages as well.

For one, bare metal tends to be *more expensive than other options*. This might seem contradictory since other options add additional layers on top of bare metal server. Those additional layers introduce monetary costs when they are from enterprise vendors. Moreover, they also introduce costs on resource usage. After all, every layer we add requires some amount on CPU, memory, hard disk, and so on. So, how can bare metal be more expensive than options that create additional costs? The answer lies in *unbalanced resource usage*. When we run applications on dedicated hosts, our resources are not at full capacity. It would be impossible to have an application that utilizes 100% of all the memory, all the CPUs, and others. No option will make the utilization be 100%. However, other solutions might allow us to get closer to that figure. Take this observation with a grain of salt. There are many different use case and the cost statement is not true in all of them.

Another potential problem is that bare metal servers are *not very agile and elastic*. It is hard to adjust capacity since we are dealing directly with physical resources. We cannot easily scale (increase capacity) or de-scale (decrease capacity).

To summarize, some of the potential advantages of bare metal servers are as follows.

* Resources dedicated to a single application, team, or department.
* Greater processing power.
* More consistent disk and network I/O performance.
* Quality of service that guarantees elimination of the noisy neighbor problem in a multitenant environment.
* Higher level of security than with other options.
* Might be cheaper than other options.

Some of the potential disadvantages are as follows.

* Might be more expensive than other options (it contradicts one of the advantages, doesn't it?).
* Not agile and elastic
* Too much capacity for most applications

The alternative to bare metal servers is virtualization.

## Virtualization

Server virtualization is a technique that involves *partitioning a physical server into a number of small, virtual servers* with the help of virtualization software. In server virtualization, each virtual server runs multiple operating system instances at the same time.

In other words, if we adopt virtualization, one physical (bare metal) server is split into multiple virtualized entities. *Each would have allocated part of the CPU, memory, and other resources*. It is, in a way, as if you split a server into multiple smaller servers.

Virtualization is based on operating systems (OS) called *hypervisors*. It is a layer between the physical hardware and multiple operating systems running on top of it. Each of those operating systems is isolated from each others and each has part of hardware resources allocated. Hypervisor's role is to create virtual machines that will run on bare metal servers. Each of those virtual machines would have OS of its own (Linux distributions like RedHat and Ubuntu, Microsoft Windows, and so on). As for hypervisors, there are multiple choices available. Some of the more commonly used are VMWare, KVM, Citrix XeriServer, Microsoft Hyper-V, and so on. The technology exists for a long time and is so mature that all options are very similar.

While virtualization exists from 60s, it become truly popular only during 90s. Even back than, many organizations failed to adopt it until early 2000. Today, *most (but not all) companies run their applications in virtualized servers*. Why did this change happen? After all, bare metal looks like it has more pros than cons.

One of the main advantages VMs offer, when compared to bare metal, are dynamic workloads. Virtual machines *can be easily created and destroyed*. Their allocated *resources can be adjusted and isolated between different VMs*.

One of the most common use cases for virtualization is *horizontal scalability*. When more servers are required, additional virtual servers can be created on existing hardware (assuming that there are unused resources).

The major problem with virtualization is that hypervisor itself *requires certain amount of resources*. Total amount of resources allocated to virtual machines is lower if bare metal would be used. As a result, *overall performance is lower*.

Finally, unlike bare metal, VMs have a *potential of the noisy neighbor effect*, *inconsistent performance*, and might have *security concerns*.

To summarize, some of the potential advantages of bare metal servers are as follows.

* Easy creation and destruction of virtualized servers
* Adjustment of allocated resources
* Resource isolation
* Horizontal scalability

Some of the potential disadvantages are as follows.

* Lower performance than bare metal
* Potential of the noisy neighbor effect
* Inconsistent performance
* Potential security concerns

And then containers become popular.

## Containers

The major problem with virtual machines is their resource usage overhead. Hypervisor needs some amount of resources. On top of that, each VM has a separate OS instance which also eats resources. If, for example, we have a physical server with ten VMs, there will be eleven operating systems. We would have a hypervisor and ten OSes, one for each VM. Compare that with bare metal that would run only one OS, and the difference can be substantial.

However, most organizations moved to virtualization because the benefits it provides are often greater than disadvantages. We can create VMs quickly and easily. Each application can sit in its own VM, isolated from the rest. Not to mention easier backups, disaster recovery, benefits to not only production, but also development environments, and so on. There are, indeed, great benefits behind virtualization but they come at a cost. Can we get some of those benefits without virtualization? The answer is yes. We can use containers.

Containers sit *on top of a physical server and its host OS*. That, in itself, saves resources since we do not need to spin up many VMs with one OS in each. Even if containers are used on top of VMs, the number of virtual machines per physical server tends to be much lower thus, still reducing the number of operating systems. As a result, containers are dramatically more efficient that VMs. We can put two to three times more containers on a server than virtual machines. A container with the whole application inside can be *as small as a few MB* while VMs are typically several GB big just for the guest Operating System (OS). In addition, Docker containers have a shared underlying host OS which means they can be packed on bare metal much more densely than VMs.

If performance would be the only benefit, there would not be so much hype around containers. Indeed, there are many other advantages. They are fast. Much faster than VMs. While it might take minutes to start a single virtual machine, a container startup time is measured in seconds, if not milliseconds. They can be created and destroyed almost instantaneously as opposed to VMs that are much heavier.

When we combine low resource usage with very short initialization times, new opportunities are opened. When running in production, we can easily update a release by deploying a new container, we can scale up and down in no time, and so on. On top of all that, developers and testers greatly benefits from containers. They can be run on laptops, testing servers, production, everywhere. The result is a very way to develop, test, and deploy software.

What makes containers behave the same no matter where they run lies in *immutability*. A container is a combination of images that are unchangeable. We create images that contain everything that our application needs. Build artifacts, configuration files, web server, and so on. Since images cannot be modified and they have everything an application needs, the result is that a container behaves the same no matter where it runs. It'll exercise the same behavior on a cheap laptop as well as on a big production server. The only exception is the speed since that depends on underlying resources.

Are containers removing the need for VMs? That depends on a use case. If we need resource separation and security is the most important concern, VMs are probably a good choice. For most other use cases, containers proved to be a better option.

Can we combine VMs and containers? We can, and we often do. The result can be the best of both world. We have the immutability, the speed, and quite a few other benefits containers provide as well as resource isolation (when needed), and security hardening from VMs. The end result are fewer VMs with containers running inside.

Does that mean that everyone runs containers inside VMs? Not really. Many organizations run containers on bare metal. It all depends on evaluation of all pros and cons of a given use case.

Containers exist for a long time but only recently they become popular. As an example, Google uses container for quite a few years. The reason for such a slow adoption lies in complexity. Until Docker came into existence, containers were very difficult to create and manage. As a result, the cost of having containers (in human hours and required knowledge) was too high. Docker simplified the whole process making containers so easy to use that any organization could master it in a relatively short time.

To summarize, some of the potential advantages of containers are as follows.

* Speed
* Low resource usage
* Immutability
* Efficiency

Some of the potential disadvantages are as follows.

* Resource isolation
* Security
